Sage Cynwrig knows her way around a pair of twenty-sided dice, and has forgotten more spells than you\'ll ever know. But when her mother is killed by a weapon of magical destruction, fantasy merges into a strange new reality. Her birthmark morphs into the Tree of Life, her boss goes full troll (warts and all), vampires start hitting on her, and shadowhunters stalk her in the darkness.

This story takes place in the London of 1909, and is based on \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\"\" Lackey creates echoes of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, pays affectionate homage to Dorothy Sayers\'s Lord Peter Wimsey (who plays an important role under a thin disguise), and turns the dwarves into seven animal avatars who masquerade as pets of her Eurasian heroine, Maya. Some of Maya\'s challenges come from the fact that she is not \"\"snow white,\"\" and she has fled India for her father\'s English homeland after the suspicious deaths of her parents. Establishing her household in London, she returns to her profession as a physician, working among the poor. Her \"\"pets\"\" and loyal servants stand guard, and Maya herself uses what bits of magic she managed to pick up in childhood to weave otherworldly defenses as well. But the implacable enemy who killed her parents has come to London to search for her', ' if Maya can be enslaved, her enormous potential powers can be used to the enemy\'s ends. Fortunately, English magicians of the White Lodge have also noted a new, powerful presence in their midst, though they\'re having trouble locating her, too.

Some will find the author\'s Kiplingesque descriptions of India and Hindustani culture offensive. Lackey describes Maya\'s enemy as a powerful devotee of the goddess Kali-Durga, though she carefully shows that the avatars of the other deities will not attack her, and has Kali-Durga repudiate her servant in the climactic confrontation. And, though the story is layered, its surface is as glossy and brightly colored as an action comic.

Glimpses of Wonderland start to bleed through her art and into her world in very disturbing ways, and Morpheus warns that Queen Red won’t be far behind.

Just another sad, love song, that was all, naught more.But a song that made a grown man’s color fade from his face. A song that made his lady cry. A song that spoke of love and loss, and more, of worlds where time was a factor gone astray. Where a traveling stranger went away for a hand of years and returned to find half a century gone by.Different worlds kept different times, he supposed that was the moral behind the tale. As if there were truly worlds and worlds, as natural as lands and lands.He ran his fingers through his hair, thinking and thinking himself to sleep. Dreams assailed him throughout that long night, dreams of him and his lady separated, rent apart by the vagaries of time and space.And in his dreams, he kept losing her, following and searching the heavens from afar. And in his dreams, the Argentene no longer shone, less the one significant star.And in his dreams, his lady’s footsteps faded into the Lakes, the unhallowed lakes through which he could not follow. And in his dreams, the seasons slowly passed, till the fertile earth turned fallow. And still, still, he found her not.And in his dreams, he feared he would grow old while searching his world for her. Till he threw himself in one unhallowed lake, and passaged his way to the stars.', '', '', 4.5, 317, 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1625698350i/58512412.jpg'),

MANY WANT TO KILL HER.Good luck to them….In the second beautifully-crafted paranormal romance of this reverse harem epic fantasy series, author Auryn Hadley explores Sal’s gently-morphing relationship to the Black Blades—her comarades-in-arms and lovers (although very little is gentle about their mating). Meanwhile, Sal continues to fight tooth and nail, blades, pikes, and shields… to fiercely protect her newfound family—and to free her people.Now that Sal has won her place in the Black Blades, an elite special ops unit of a superpower race within the army of the Conglomerate of Free Citizens, she’s struggling a bit to navigate her unconventional arrangement with what can only be described as her harem: she has seven devoted warriors and potential lovers to choose from, all of whom would willingly submit to both her command—and her unquenchable desire. First there’s Blaec, Sal’s first lover, who does his best to guide her—with the full understanding that she will eclipse him, and that he must prepare her to do so. But his struggle is the opposite of Sal’s: he is only half iliri, and all-too-human. The salvation of the iliri race and the Conglomerate depends on his ability to walk in both worlds—and to guide Sal to trust her own instincts, to trust what comes naturally. For the matriarchal iliri, what is natural is that Sal is the undisputed leader of her pack. She makes everyone better; she especially makes everyone fight better. Which is welcome news as the Conglomerate faces unspeakably violent attacks from the Emperor of Terric, who wants to exterminate the entire iliri species and is moving to conquer every country between his own and the Conglomerate. All the while, Sal comes closer and closer to what she’s meant to become—the iliri’s only hope. Author Auryn Hadley toes a delicate line throughout Instinctual—it reads as much like an achingly sexy unconventional love story as it does an action-packed military epic (with a distinctly female bent).  And as in any great romance, it’s the developing relationships that shine in these pages—as does Sal herself, one of science fiction’s most ferocious heroines. You’ll fall in love with her a little more with every book you devour.Women readers will thrill to the reverse harem idea that pushes the boundaries of epic dark fantasy in this groundbreaking series that may remind some of Avatar without the scary beasts; or even Game Of Thrones, but happier, with more color—and starring a dazzling female protagonist. Fans of Anne McCaffrey’s Dragonriders of Pern will find Sal’s planet Ogun a thrilling destination for their next fantasy fix.Oh, and by the way: This is a complete novel, not a cliffhanger.

I was the only person left to inherit the family business and I’m doing my best to keep it up and running in honor of my loved ones. These days, my biggest challenge is telling off a rampaging customer, and endless paperwork. That is, until he shows up again.Darius was the only guy I couldn’t say no to, the one who dragged me into the world of the occult in the first place. When he shows up and begs me to assist with an exorcism, I reluctantly agree. He’s still using me; because I’m the best exorcist around and he only calls when he needs my help.Before I know it, I’ve got an incubus in the living room, a hellhound marking around my yard, and a demon prince who can’t decide if he wants to kill me or… you know. Not to mention the vampire and the Nephilim I seem to have collected. Normally I wouldn’t work with the supernatural, but we all have a common goal. Prevent the crime syndicate from summoning a demon prince and becoming more powerful than we can hope to handle.If I can keep my cool, it will be a miracle. If I can hold on to my soul it’ll be an even bigger one. No one ever claimed being an exorcist was easy, but to protect those I’m coming to love, I’ll pay whatever price necessary.This book is intended for mature audiences. 18+ readers only!

('The Culling Trials ', 'K.F. Breene', 'You Don’t Choose The Academy. The Academy Chooses You.   I had no idea how those words would change my life. Or how they’d changed my life already…  Until the day the most dangerous man I’ve ever met waltzed onto my farm and left us a death sentence.  In an invitation.  My younger brother has been chosen for the prestigious, secret magical school hidden within the folds of our mundane world. A place so dangerous, they don’t guarantee you’ll make it out alive.  If he doesn\'t go our entire family will be killed.  It’s the same invitation my older brother received three years ago—the same place he mysteriously died.  The academy has already killed one sibling. I’ll be damned if they take another.  I do the only thing an older sister can: chop off my hair, strap on two bras to flatten the girls, and take my brother’s place.  Magic and monsters are real. Assassins are coming for me, and the dead are prone to rise. What’s a girl faking it as a boy supposed to do? That’s right—beat the academy at its own game.  Or die trying.
